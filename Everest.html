            <b>Everest</b> is a female Husky pup who lives on the mountain with Jake. She was made an official member of the PAW Patrol after helping them with a rescue mission. She may live in a snowy, cold place, but her heart is warm. Always ready to lend a paw, Everest is playful, fearless, and full of energy. There's nothing in the rule book that says a dog can't clear snow and keep Adventure Bay safe! Everest is a fearless and feisty eight-year-old Husky pup and the teams amazing forest ranger. She is completely at home in the wild and is a big help to Jake up on his mountain.
