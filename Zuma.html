            <b>Zuma</b>, in Paw Patrol, is a playful, chocolate Labrador retriever pup who serves as the team's dedicated water rescue dog; known for his love of the water, surfing, and a cheerful personality, he's always ready to "dive in" and help with any underwater rescue mission, often using his orange hovercraft that can operate both on land and water; his catchphrase is "Let's dive in!".He's always trying to get the more serious pups like Chase and Rubble to “lighten up.”
