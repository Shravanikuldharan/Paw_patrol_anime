            <b>Rocky</b> from Paw Patrol is a mixed-breed dog who serves as the team's "recycling pup," known for his creative and handyman abilities, using old items to fix things and build new creations; he's always encouraging others to "reuse" and not waste, driving a green recycling truck and often coming up with innovative solutions to problems, while having a slight aversion to getting wet.Rocky uses his handy claw to pick up pieces that could be recycled and use them for other purposes.
